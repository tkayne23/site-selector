site-selector
==============

The Site Selector application is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps business owners and corporations locate available buildings and sites, and combine their property search with key community and business demographic information. We have two configurations of this application focused on the workflows for State and Local Governments.

* Try the [Site Selector (State Government) application](http://links.esri.com/stategovernment/tryit/SiteSelector)
* Try the [Site Selector (Local Government) application](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/tryit/SiteSelector)

The Residential Comp Finder application is another configuration of the site-selector application that can be used by citizens, real estate agents and appraisers to find comparable sales and related property information.

* Try the [Residential Comp Finder application](http://links.esri.com/localgovernment/tryit/ResidentialCompFinder/)

## Features

* Search for a place by name, by current location, by address
* Review ammenities at a given place, assess demographic  variables
* Share information via social media

## Requirements

**Start now using Esri-supplied sample services**

You can start using the application now by setting it up on a web server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and using sample services supplied by Esri.
You'll need to convert to an application in IIS and use the ASP .NET 4.0. application pool.
